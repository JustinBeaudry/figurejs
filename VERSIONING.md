</p>

Figure uses [semver][semver]-like versioning, but does not prescribe to the semver 
philosophy. However versions are still published in the SemVer grammar.
Breaking changes are not allowed in Figure. If a version is published that
breaks anything it will be unpublished.

Figure values compatibility and supports accretion. 
As such once the Core API has been defined it's respective signatures, 
and return results will never be changed.

See the [Rich Hickey talk on Closure Spec][versioning] for context.
